## Background
The Sterimool parameters were developed by Verloop to describe the steric size
of substituents. L can be described as the depth of the substituent and is
defined as the distance between the dummy atom 1 (by definition H) and its
neighbor in substituent. For historical reasons, L is corrected by adding 0.40
to this length. This difference is due to a shift from C(sp<sup>2</sup>) to H
as dummy atom.

B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>5</sub> can be described as the minimum and maximum
rotational size of the substituent. They are defined as the shortest and longest
vectors from atom 2 to a tangent plane of the vdW surface.

Steriplus calculates the Sterimol parameters by first generating points on the
vdW surface of the molecule and then projecting these points onto a set of
vectors. L is determined by projection onto the vector between atoms 1 and 2.
B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>5</sub> are obtained by projection onto vectors
perpendicular to L.
