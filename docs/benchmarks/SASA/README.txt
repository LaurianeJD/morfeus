* The GEPOL93 program was downloaded 2019-03-20 from
http://www.ccl.net/cca/software/SOURCES/FORTRAN/molecular_surface/gepol93/index.shtml
* FreeSASA was obtained from with pip from PyPi on 2019-03-20.
* The same CRC radii where used both for morfeus, FreeSASA and GEPOL93.
* morfeus used a density of 0.01, the same total number of points were then
used for FreeSASA while GEPOL93 used the finest setting of NDIV=5.
